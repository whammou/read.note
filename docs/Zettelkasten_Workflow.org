        </p>
        #+end_html
  2. Pick up from =fleeting note= and translate into =literature note=
     1. Write it in your own words
     2. Write with great care so that revision is possible
     3. Keep it only idea per note
        - If you need to define a term for the concept, create a =term definition= card and link to it
     4. Include the source you got the idea from
     5. Include relevant citation (LastName, year, pp.22)
        #+name: literature note

        #+end_html
  3. Translating from =literature note= into a =permanent note=
     1. =Literature note= are written in *context of the source*. Whereas =permanent note= is written on context of *your own idea*
     2. =Literature  note= should have only 1 connection. While =permanent notes= have many connections
        - To individual notes
        - As part of multiple topics
     3. =Permanent notes= are connectable across multiple =contexts=
        - Content First topics
